## Problem statement 1: Drop packets using eBPF
  * Implemented ebpf c code and usersapce go code for configuring the port
  * Steps to test are clearly explained in this [demo.md](https://github.com/GLVSKiriti/AccounoxAssignment/blob/main/problem1/demo.md)

## Problem statement 2: Drop packets only for a given process

## Problem Statement 3: Explain the code snippet
  * Clearly explained in this [code_explaination.md](https://github.com/GLVSKiriti/AccounoxAssignment/blob/main/problem3/code_explaination.md)
